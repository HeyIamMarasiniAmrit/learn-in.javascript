Adding
The addition operator (+) adds numbers:
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x + y;

Subtracting
The subtraction operator (-) subtracts numbers.
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x - y;

Multiplying
The multiplication operator (*) multiplies numbers.
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x * y;

Dividing
The division operator (/) divides numbers.
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x / y;

Remainder
The modulus operator (%) returns the division remainder.
let x = 5;
let y = 2;
let z = x % y;

Incrementing
The increment operator (++) increments numbers.
let x = 5;
x++;
let z = x;

Decrementing
The decrement operator (--) decrements numbers.
let x = 5;
x--;
let z = x;

Exponentiation
The exponentiation operator (**) raises the first operand to the power of the second operand.
let x = 5;
let z = x ** 2;
